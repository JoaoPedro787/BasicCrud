## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MySQL (TiDB) and Vercel (for hosting the server)
- **Frontend**: React JS, Tailwind CSS, and Axios (for API requests)

---

## üíª Backend

### Backend Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete records from the MySQL database.
- **Database Interaction**: Data is stored and retrieved from a MySQL database.
- **Error Handling**: The API includes error handling for invalid requests and server issues.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend and API Integration

The frontend was developed using React JS. The communication with the API is done via HTTP requests using Axios.

### Frontend Features
- Displaying a list of records obtained from the API.
- Forms for creating, updating, and deleting records.
- Dynamic interface updates based on backend responses.

## üéØ Project Goal

This project was developed with a primary focus on enhancing my skills and knowledge in key areas of full-stack development. It allowed me to dive deep into both backend and frontend development, and I gained valuable hands-on experience in the following aspects:

- **Building RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express**: I learned how to create a robust and scalable API using Express, a popular framework for Node.js, and honed my ability to structure and manage APIs effectively.
  
- **Database Management with MySQL**: Setting up and managing a MySQL database gave me a deeper understanding of relational databases, how to design schemas, and how to interact with data securely and efficiently through queries. I also learned how to connect the backend to a database and handle CRUD operations.

- **Connecting the Frontend with the Backend**: This project strengthened my ability to build a dynamic and responsive frontend with React.js, and I learned how to connect it seamlessly with the backend API using Axios to fetch data. It was an excellent opportunity to see the full flow of data from the database to the frontend interface.

- **Error Handling and Debugging**: Along the way, I had the chance to refine my problem-solving and debugging skills by encountering and resolving issues related to database connections, API requests, and front-end updates. This experience greatly improved my ability to troubleshoot and optimize code.

- **Full-Stack Development**: By combining frontend (React) with backend (Node.js, Express, MySQL), I gained valuable insight into full-stack development. I became more comfortable with both ends of the stack and learned how they communicate and work together in a seamless workflow.

- **Deployment Experience**: The process of deploying the project on Vercel allowed me to understand how to prepare a project for production, manage environments, and ensure the application is ready for real-world use.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JoaoPedro787/BasicBackend.git
    cd BasicBackend
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ### Backend
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
    ---
    ### Frontend
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

3. Install MySQL and create the database:
    - If you don't have MySQL installed, you can download it [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).
    - Once installed, start the MySQL server.
    - Create a new database:
      ```bash
      CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS nodeAPI;
      USE nodeAPI;
      
      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
          id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
          email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
          password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, 
          created_in TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP 
      );
      ```
    - Configure the database connection in your backend by setting up the `.env` file with your MySQL connection details:
      ```
      DB_HOST=localhost
      DB_USER=root
      DB_PASS=yourpassword
      DB_NAME=nodeAPI
      DB_PORT=5000
      ```

4. Start the project:
    ### Backend
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start
    ```
    ---
    ### Frontend
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start
    ```

5. Open the project in your browser:
    - Backend: `http://localhost:5000` or `http://localhost:5500`
    - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
